# hookah
WARNING: This is the old WebSocket-only version of hookah and is no longer being
maintained.

hookah is a lightweight pipeline tool for orchestrating WebSocket streams.

Operations like fanning-in multiple data sources, fanning-out to multiple
consumers, and applying local map/filter operations between endpoints are all
possible using hookah and standard POSIX pipes.
